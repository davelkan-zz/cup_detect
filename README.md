<h4> solo cup detect </h4> 
This is a simple image recognition script that detects red solo cups using SimpleCV (built on top of OpenCV).<br>

It currently classifies on the basis of color and relative size, but is crucially missing a shape or template based filtering component. <br>

* Look into training a Haar classifier.
